## Welcome to Lesson 01!

Please click the big green "Code" button to download this repository as a .zip file. Please extract it to a convenient location (e.g. your Notebooks dir) so you can open it in JupyterLab.

This first lesson will introduce you to the following:

1. Using JupyterLab
2. An introduction to Markdown
3. An introduction to the sympy `Beam` module
4. An introduction to handcalcs

The goals of this first lesson:

1. Get you comfortable running code in JupyterLab
2. Practice performing simple beam analyses in sympy
3. Demonstrate the value of using JupyterLab for engineering calculations

We will also complete the setup of your JupyterLab environment by installing the packages required throughout the course and setting up a convenient keyboard shortcut for you.
